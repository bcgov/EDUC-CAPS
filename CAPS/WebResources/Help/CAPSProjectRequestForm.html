    <h1>Project Request Form</h1><p>Welcome to the Help Guide. To provide a better user experience, each section references a tab, with General being applicable to all submission categories. Tabs such as Preliminary Budget, and PRFS are applicable to multiple submission categories, and thus have their own help section. In order for the help bubbles appear, please ensure you are on the designated tab prior to clicking the links. </p><p></p><p></p><collapsible title="General" collapsed="true"><p>Saving your changes can be done in multiple ways. </p><ol><li><p><balloon target="[data-lp-id=&quot;Form:caps_project-caps_project|NoRelationship|Form|Mscrm.Form.caps_project.Save&quot;]" title="Ribbon Save Buttons" details="Both &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Save &amp; Close&quot; can be found here">Ribbon Buttons</balloon> on the top left hand corner.</p></li><li><p><balloon target="[data-lp-id=&quot;form-footer-saveBtn&quot;]" title="Footer Save Button" details="On all forms, there will be a this button on the bottom left hand corner of the footer.">Save button</balloon> on the bottom left hand corner</p></li><li><p>CTRL + S on your keyboard</p></li><li><p>Auto-save, triggered every 30 seconds</p></li></ol><p></p><p>How is the name of a Project Request determined?
